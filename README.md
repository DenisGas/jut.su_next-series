Chrome extension for [Jut.su](https://jut.su/) which makes video auto-play, auto-skip anime intro, and auto-open next series after the end of the current one.

If you want the anime to go full screen automatically, I made a [python script](https://github.com/DenisGas/watch_jut.su) that does that.

## Features:

- Automatically plays video ‚úåÔ∏è
- Automatically skip anime intro üî•
- Open next episode ü§©
- One click to FullScreen(Overlay) üëç
- Video hotkey work (Press "F" to fullScreen) ‚ù§Ô∏è

## How to install/use extension

To use the extension on your phone, you can use the Kivi Browser.

### Install (Chrome store)

[download from chrome store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jutsu-next-series/godmnckhgkgojikjpiahppfnmhgkfpjp)

1. "–°–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–∞—è —Å–µ—Ä–∏—è –¥–æ —Ç–∏—Ç—Ä–æ–≤" - auto-transition to the next series on credits, before the video end.
2. "–°–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–∞—è —Å–µ—Ä–∏—è –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–∞ —Å–µ—Ä–∏–∏" - auto-transition to the next series after the video end.

4. "–í–∏–¥–µ–æ —Å —Å–∞–º–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∞" - starts the series from the beginning
5. "One click to fullScreen" - create overlay which, when clicked, opens the video in full screen.

## Some Error

-  After reloading the page, the autoplay video does not work
   
    - **Console error**\
       ![GoogleErrorImg](./img/G_Error.png)

       Due to Google's policy that video auto-play does not work before the user has interacted with the site.

       After reloading the page, video auto-play does not work. But the next series will start.
    
    - **Fix**
       Also, if you make a [PWA from the site](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/3060053#zippy=%2Cadd-an-app-from-the-chrome-web-store), even after restarting the site, autoplay will work (checked Chrome and Edge)
